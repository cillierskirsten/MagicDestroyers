<h1>MagicDestroyers - My First Project</h1>
<p>--Aug 2020--<br/></p>
<h2>What is MagicDestoyers?</h2>
<p>Magic Destroyers is a console application game created using object oriented programming (OOP). It was created while completing my First Online C# Programming Course. I found the course insightful and the way the instructor integrated material with regular challenges and practical exercises made sure that I could put theory into practice, and use my newly acquired C# skills to produce a project of substance. This demonstrates my skills in the long road ahead of programming and I look forward to adding more material in future as well as update this project as I learn more.</p>
<h2>The Course and Instructor</h2>
<p>The course was hosted by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> and run by Tod Vachev. Tod graduated at Technical University of Varna as a Robotics Engineer. With several years of experience as a Passionate Developer and Engineer, he now calls himself an Online Entrepreneur & Instructor - and delivers courses that are easy to follow and I would highly recommend for novice developers such as myself. </p>
<h2>The Challenges and Exercises</h2>
<p>Throughout each section I had to complete in-lecture exercises and coding challenges. This has been proven to be the best way to learn, practice and internalise the fundamentals of C#. Each topic had a new challenge, and I wish I could say that I easily complete all without reviewing the instructors notes and samples, but I can't. And that's ok, it is ok that some parts illuded my general knowledge and understanding - through mistakes we learn. <br/>By the end of the course I finally produced my own project, all be it closely aligned to Tod's version, but my own none-the-less. I can confidently say I now have the skills and knowledge to embark on the next part of my journey in the world of Programming and look forward creating project and applications to demonstrate my knowledge.</p>
